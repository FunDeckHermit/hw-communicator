# HW-communicator
Devices that can communicate state to one another. 

Project uses a Raspberry Pi Pico W, a Lora antenna, TP4056 lithium-ion cell charger to transmit a selected phrase.
This selected phrase is picked up by another module and displayed.

All firmware code is written in micropython. 

Todo: 
 * Wifi communication
 * LoraWAN communication
 * Pickup firmware
 
What would I do differently:
 * Add USB-B port somewhere
 * Add buzzer
 * Move 18650 holder a bit higher
